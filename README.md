# AI-Powered E-commerce Assistant

An implementation of a smart e-commerce virtual assistant, inspired by the projects at Abzooba Inc. This project combines a multi-turn conversational agent with a deep learning-based recommender system and computer vision models for product parsing and similar-item retrieval.

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to build the key components of an AI-powered virtual assistant for a fashion e-commerce platform. The system is designed to understand user queries, handle multi-turn conversations, parse clothing items from images, and provide personalized recommendations. It integrates multiple AI disciplines: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Recommender Systems.

## 2. Core Objectives

-   To build a **multi-turn conversational agent** that can understand and respond to user queries in context.
-   To implement a **cloth parsing** model that can identify and segment clothing items from an image.
-   To create a **similar image retrieval** system to find visually similar products in a large catalog.
-   To develop a **deep recommender system** for personalized product suggestions.

## 3. Methodology

This project is divided into three interconnected modules that form the complete assistant.

### Module 1: Conversational Agent

1.  **Problem Formulation**: This is a conversational AI task. The goal is to build an agent that can maintain context over multiple user queries and responses. The resume mentions using **Memory Networks**, a specific architecture for this.
2.  **Dataset**: We can use a public conversational dataset like [Meta AI's Task-Oriented Dialog (TOD) dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/TOD-bAbI-plus) or create a synthetic dataset of e-commerce queries (e.g., "I'm looking for a blue shirt," followed by "how about in a smaller size?").
3.  **Model**:
    -   **Intent Recognition**: A simple model (e.g., using BERT or a simple classifier) to understand the user's intent (e.g., `search`, `recommend`, `clarify`).
    -   **Dialog Management**: Implement a simplified version of a **Memory Network**. This involves:
        -   A "memory" component to store the history of the conversation (previous queries and responses).
        -   An "attention mechanism" that allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the conversation history when generating a new response.

### Module 2: Vision System (Cloth Parsing & Retrieval)

1.  **Dataset**: We'll use a fashion dataset with images and annotations, like [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) or [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) for a simpler version.
2.  **Cloth Parsing**: This is a semantic segmentation task. We can use a pre-trained segmentation model like **U-Net** or **Mask R-CNN** and fine-tune it on our fashion dataset to identify pixels belonging to specific clothing items (e.g., 'shirt', 'pants').
3.  **Similar Image Retrieval**:
    -   **Feature Extraction**: Use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like **ResNet-50** (without its final classification layer) to extract a feature vector (embedding) for every product image in the catalog.
    -   **Similarity Search**: When a user provides an image, extract its feature vector. Then, use an efficient search algorithm (like **FAISS** from Facebook AI) to find the images in the catalog with the closest feature vectors (using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).

### Module 3: Deep Recommender System

1.  **Problem Formulation**: This goes beyond traditional collaborative filtering. A deep recommender system can use a neural network to learn complex user-item interactions.
2.  **Model Architecture**: We can implement a **Wide & Deep** model:
    -   **Wide Component**: A simple linear model that learns from sparse, manually engineered features (e.g., user's location, product category). This captures simple, memorable rules.
    -   **Deep Component**: A deep neural network (DNN) that takes dense features (like user and item embeddings from a collaborative filtering model) and learns complex, non-linear relationships.
    -   The outputs of both components are combined to produce a final recommendation score.
